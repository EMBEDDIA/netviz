### NetViz: a graph visualization web application

NetViz is a single page, client only web application which enables easy visualization of networks. It does not require installation and supports CSV input format which is easy to read and write. It is based on [vis.js](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network) and allows for interactive visualization of fairly "big" networks (up to 1000 nodes or so).

#### Requirements
None except a recent web browser

#### How to use
Download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Check the header lines of the sample data to get an idea how to format your own data. If you are familiar with Javascript and [vis.js](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network), you can easily add your own node and edge attributes to the input format.
